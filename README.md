## ðŸ›  About This Project

This is a small web-based calculator designed to help organize and calculate your S1 and S2 module marks. It features a clean, **stylized interface**, a **table view**, and a **missing module mode** to help you handle incomplete data easily.

The project is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** â€” no backend or database involved.

Yes, I used AI to help me code this â€” so ** donâ€™t judge me **. It was a fun learning experience, and it works.....I think at least...

## ðŸ”“ Open Source

This project is open source and available for anyone to fork, improve, or build on. Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own tools or experiments.

## âœ¨ Features

-  Table View to enter and visualize module data.
-  Missing Module Mode to work even if you donâ€™t have all your results yet.


## ðŸš§ Disclaimer

This was made with the help of AI and for learning purposes. 

Itâ€™s simple, functional, and still a work in progress â€” so donâ€™t expect anything fancy.
