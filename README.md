# 📚 1CP S1 & S2 Semester Calculator

## 🛠 About This Project

This is a small web-based calculator designed to help organize and calculate your S1 and S2 module marks. It features a clean, **stylized interface**, a **table view**, and a **missing module mode** to help you handle incomplete data easily.

The project is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no backend or database involved.

Yes, I used AI to help me code this — so ** don’t judge me **. It was a fun learning experience, and it works.....I think at least...

## 🔓 Open Source

This project is open source and available for anyone to fork, improve, or build on. Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own tools or experiments.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 Table View to enter and visualize module data.
- ❓ Missing Module Mode to work even if you don’t have all your results yet.
- 🎨 A stylized layout for a cleaner and smoother user experience.
- 🖥 Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚧 Disclaimer

This was made with the help of AI and for learning purposes. It’s simple, functional, and still a work in progress — so don’t expect anything fancy.
